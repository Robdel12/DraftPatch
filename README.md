# DraftPatch

**DraftPatch** is a simple and practical macOS app built to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs)
such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and locally hosted Ollama models into your workflow. It helps you
draft, refine, and improve your text and code directly within native macOS applications.

Whether you're coding in Xcode, editing in Emacs, jotting notes, or working within iTerm, DraftPatch
provides seamless, context-aware AI suggestions based on the currently selected text or the content
of your application's active window.
